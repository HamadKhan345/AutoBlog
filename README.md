# AutoBlog

AutoBlog is an in-progress Django-based blogging platform designed to make content creation and discovery seamless and modern.

Our goal is to build an intelligent blogging platform that leverages AI to automate content creation. In the future, users will be able to provide a topic, and our integrated AI will:

- Search the web for relevant information
- Scrape and verify sources
- Automatically generate and publish a well-written blog post
